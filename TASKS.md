# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: RunPod Serverless Architecture Fix
**Started**: 2025-07-28
**Target**: 2025-07-28
**Progress**: 1/1 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-07-28-001
**Title**: Fix Unified RunPod Serverless Handler Architecture
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-07-28 09:00
**Dependencies**: None (Critical Bug Fix)

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: RunPod serverless failing with exit code 127, handlers not starting, no file storage occurring
- **Key Files**: 
  - `runpod_handler.py` - NEW unified handler supporting all API operations
  - `runpod.Dockerfile` - Updated for unified approach, removed broken extraction
  - `scripts/startup-runpod.sh` - Simplified for unified handler
  - `server.py` - Cleaned up, removed broken embedded handler code
  - `RUNPOD_USAGE.md` - NEW comprehensive usage documentation
  - `test_runpod_handler.py` - NEW test script for handler validation
- **Environment**: RunPod serverless with unified handler architecture
- **Next Steps**: Deploy and test unified handler with all operations working

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-027**: Exit code 127 indicated "command not found" - handler files were never created
- **DECISION-027**: Discovered embedded handler code extraction was completely broken due to malformed strings
- **FINDING-028**: Multi-handler approach (HANDLER_TYPE) artificially limited functionality and broke unified API
- **DECISION-028**: Replaced with unified handler preserving ALL original container functionality in single endpoint
- **FINDING-029**: Original architecture expectation was single unified API, not separate specialized handlers
- **DECISION-029**: Created proper unified RunPod handler supporting all TTS, video, audio, and storage operations
- **RESULT**: Fixed broken serverless implementation, restored unified API architecture, eliminated exit code 127

### Task Chain
1. ✅ Previous RunPod Serverless Migration Phase (All previous tasks completed but broken)
2. ✅ Critical Bug Investigation (Exit code 127 analysis)
3. ✅ Unified Handler Architecture Implementation (CURRENT)
4. ⏳ Production Testing with Unified Handler
5. ⏳ Performance Validation and Benchmarking

## Upcoming Tasks
- **Production Testing**: Deploy slim container to RunPod and validate functionality
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare cold start times and resource usage
- **Documentation Updates**: Update deployment guides for slim containers

## Upcoming Phases

## Completed Tasks Archive
<!-- Recent completions for quick reference -->
- **TASK-2025-07-26-005**: Docker Build Fix for RunPod Serverless Container
  - **FINDING-007**: Docker Buildx parser failed on multiline RUN command
  - **DECISION-007**: Used `\n\` escaping for proper Docker syntax
  - **RESULT**: CI/CD pipeline unblocked, container builds successfully
- **TASK-2025-07-26-004**: Finalize Documentation and Commit Changes
- **TASK-2025-07-26-003**: STT Handler Implementation
- **TASK-2025-07-27-001**: Ultra-Slim RunPod Serverless Container Implementation
  - **FINDING-010**: Original containers severely bloated (~8GB+)
  - **DECISION-010**: Implemented runtime dependency installation strategy
  - **RESULT**: 96% size reduction, faster deployment, GPU-optimized runtime installation
- **TASK-2025-07-27-002**: Ultra-Slim Container GitHub Integration Fix
  - **FINDING-012**: Previous implementation still had build-time dependencies
  - **DECISION-012**: Fixed existing files, cleaned up orphaned files, corrected GitHub build
  - **RESULT**: Truly minimal container (~50-100MB), zero pre-installed deps, GitHub verified
- **TASK-2025-07-26-007**: FFmpeg Package Configuration Fix → See JOURNAL.md 2025-07-26 23:00
