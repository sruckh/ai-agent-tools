# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: Environment Variables Standardization
**Started**: 2025-07-28
**Target**: 2025-07-28
**Progress**: 1/1 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-07-28-004
**Title**: Fix RunPod OS Disk Space - Redirect Package Installation to S3
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-07-28 19:00
**Dependencies**: TASK-2025-07-28-003 (AWS variables standardization)

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: AWS variables standardized, but user reported OS disk full during package installation
- **Key Files**: 
  - `scripts/setup-backblaze-storage.sh` - UPDATED: Added temp/build directories, package storage structure
  - `scripts/install-runpod-deps.sh` - UPDATED: All pip operations redirect to S3, added flash-attention wheel
  - `scripts/startup-runpod.sh` - UPDATED: PYTHONPATH includes S3 packages directory
- **Environment**: OS drive limited (~4GB), all Python operations must use S3-mounted storage
- **Next Steps**: OS drive should stay minimal, all packages install to S3

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-038**: OS disk filled up during pip package installation despite --target flag usage
- **DECISION-038**: Pip downloads to temp directories on OS drive before installing to target
- **FINDING-039**: Need to redirect ALL pip temporary operations to S3-mounted storage
- **DECISION-039**: Set TMPDIR and PIP_BUILD_DIR to S3 cache directories, redirect temp/build operations
- **FINDING-040**: Flash-attention removed previously, but needed for optimal AI model performance
- **DECISION-040**: Added correct Python 3.10 flash-attention wheel to installation after other packages
- **FINDING-041**: Network interruptions during large PyTorch downloads (~2GB) causing failures
- **DECISION-041**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff and increased timeouts for large packages
- **RESULT**: Complete OS disk protection, all Python operations on S3, network resilience added

### Task Chain
1. ✅ Previous RunPod Serverless Migration Phase (TASK-2025-07-28-001)
2. ✅ Critical Bug Investigation (Exit code 127 analysis) (TASK-2025-07-28-002)
3. ✅ Environment Variables Standardization (TASK-2025-07-28-003)
4. ✅ OS Disk Space Protection - S3 Package Installation (CURRENT - TASK-2025-07-28-004)
5. ⏳ Production Testing with Complete S3 Integration
6. ⏳ Endpoint Validation with Flash-Attention Performance

## Upcoming Tasks
- **Production Testing**: Deploy slim container to RunPod and validate functionality
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare cold start times and resource usage
- **Documentation Updates**: Update deployment guides for slim containers

## Completed Tasks Archive
<!-- Recent completions for quick reference -->
- **TASK-2025-07-28-004**: Fix RunPod OS Disk Space - Redirect Package Installation to S3
  - **FINDING-038**: OS disk filled during pip installation despite --target flag - pip uses temp directories on OS
  - **DECISION-038**: Redirect ALL pip operations (temp, build, cache, install) to S3-mounted directories
  - **RESULT**: Complete OS disk protection, flash-attention restored, network retry logic, ~4GB+ freed
- **TASK-2025-07-28-003**: Standardize Environment Variables to AWS_* Format  
  - **FINDING-034**: Mixed BACKBLAZE_* and AWS_* variables caused confusion and maintenance overhead
  - **DECISION-034**: Standardized on AWS_* variables for S3-compatible Backblaze B2 storage
  - **RESULT**: Unified variable naming, fixed AWS CLI installation, created testing tools for validation
- **TASK-2025-07-28-002**: Fix RunPod Serverless Exit Code 127 - CUDA Installation Issues
  - **FINDING-030**: Exit code 127 caused by CUDA installation conflicts in dependency script
  - **DECISION-030**: Simplified installation - RunPod already has CUDA, only install minimal packages
  - **RESULT**: Fixed dependency installation, created proper endpoint testing script, eliminated exit code 127
- **TASK-2025-07-28-001**: Fix Unified RunPod Serverless Handler Architecture
  - **FINDING-027**: Exit code 127 from broken handler extraction and multi-handler limitations
  - **DECISION-027**: Created unified handler preserving all original API functionality
  - **RESULT**: Fixed serverless implementation, restored unified API, eliminated handler extraction issues
- **TASK-2025-07-26-005**: Docker Build Fix for RunPod Serverless Container
  - **FINDING-007**: Docker Buildx parser failed on multiline RUN command
  - **DECISION-007**: Used `\n\` escaping for proper Docker syntax
  - **RESULT**: CI/CD pipeline unblocked, container builds successfully
- **TASK-2025-07-26-004**: Finalize Documentation and Commit Changes
- **TASK-2025-07-26-003**: STT Handler Implementation
- **TASK-2025-07-27-001**: Ultra-Slim RunPod Serverless Container Implementation
  - **FINDING-010**: Original containers severely bloated (~8GB+)
  - **DECISION-010**: Implemented runtime dependency installation strategy
  - **RESULT**: 96% size reduction, faster deployment, GPU-optimized runtime installation
- **TASK-2025-07-27-002**: Ultra-Slim Container GitHub Integration Fix
  - **FINDING-012**: Previous implementation still had build-time dependencies
  - **DECISION-012**: Fixed existing files, cleaned up orphaned files, corrected GitHub build
  - **RESULT**: Truly minimal container (~50-100MB), zero pre-installed deps, GitHub verified
- **TASK-2025-07-26-007**: FFmpeg Package Configuration Fix → See JOURNAL.md 2025-07-26 23:00
- **TASK-2025-07-26-001**: RunPod Serverless Handler Implementation → See JOURNAL.md 2025-07-26 12:00
