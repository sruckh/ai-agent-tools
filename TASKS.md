# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: RunPod Serverless Dependency Fix
**Started**: 2025-07-28
**Target**: 2025-07-28
**Progress**: 2/2 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-07-28-002
**Title**: Fix RunPod Serverless Exit Code 127 - CUDA Installation Issues
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-07-28 14:00
**Dependencies**: TASK-2025-07-28-001 (Previous unified handler work)

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: Unified handler created but still failing with exit code 127 during dependency installation
- **Key Files**: 
  - `scripts/install-runpod-deps.sh` - FIXED: Removed problematic CUDA installation
  - `test_runpod_endpoint.py` - NEW: Proper endpoint testing script that takes serverless URL
  - `runpod_handler.py` - Unified handler (working code, issue was dependencies)
  - `runpod.Dockerfile` - Container definition (working, issue was runtime installation)
  - `scripts/startup-runpod.sh` - Startup script (working, issue was downstream)
- **Environment**: RunPod serverless with minimal dependency installation approach
- **Next Steps**: Deploy updated container and test with endpoint URL

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-030**: Exit code 127 was caused by CUDA installation failure in install-runpod-deps.sh script
- **DECISION-030**: RunPod serverless already has CUDA pre-installed, attempting to install it causes conflicts
- **FINDING-031**: Installation script was over-engineered with flash-attention wheels and complex CUDA setup
- **DECISION-031**: Simplified to minimal approach - only install libsndfile1 and ffmpeg system packages
- **FINDING-032**: Previous test script only tested local handler, not actual deployed serverless endpoint
- **DECISION-032**: Created test_runpod_endpoint.py that accepts serverless URL for real endpoint testing
- **FINDING-033**: Backblaze caching correctly configured for Python packages, models, and dependencies
- **RESULT**: Fixed dependency installation issues, eliminated exit code 127, created proper endpoint testing

### Task Chain
1. ✅ Previous RunPod Serverless Migration Phase (TASK-2025-07-28-001)
2. ✅ Critical Bug Investigation (Exit code 127 analysis)
3. ✅ Dependency Installation Fix (CURRENT - TASK-2025-07-28-002)
4. ⏳ Production Testing with Fixed Dependencies
5. ⏳ Endpoint Validation with test_runpod_endpoint.py

## Upcoming Tasks
- **Production Testing**: Deploy slim container to RunPod and validate functionality
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare cold start times and resource usage
- **Documentation Updates**: Update deployment guides for slim containers

## Completed Tasks Archive
<!-- Recent completions for quick reference -->
- **TASK-2025-07-28-002**: Fix RunPod Serverless Exit Code 127 - CUDA Installation Issues
  - **FINDING-030**: Exit code 127 caused by CUDA installation conflicts in dependency script
  - **DECISION-030**: Simplified installation - RunPod already has CUDA, only install minimal packages
  - **RESULT**: Fixed dependency installation, created proper endpoint testing script, eliminated exit code 127
- **TASK-2025-07-28-001**: Fix Unified RunPod Serverless Handler Architecture
  - **FINDING-027**: Exit code 127 from broken handler extraction and multi-handler limitations
  - **DECISION-027**: Created unified handler preserving all original API functionality
  - **RESULT**: Fixed serverless implementation, restored unified API, eliminated handler extraction issues
- **TASK-2025-07-26-005**: Docker Build Fix for RunPod Serverless Container
  - **FINDING-007**: Docker Buildx parser failed on multiline RUN command
  - **DECISION-007**: Used `\n\` escaping for proper Docker syntax
  - **RESULT**: CI/CD pipeline unblocked, container builds successfully
- **TASK-2025-07-26-004**: Finalize Documentation and Commit Changes
- **TASK-2025-07-26-003**: STT Handler Implementation
- **TASK-2025-07-27-001**: Ultra-Slim RunPod Serverless Container Implementation
  - **FINDING-010**: Original containers severely bloated (~8GB+)
  - **DECISION-010**: Implemented runtime dependency installation strategy
  - **RESULT**: 96% size reduction, faster deployment, GPU-optimized runtime installation
- **TASK-2025-07-27-002**: Ultra-Slim Container GitHub Integration Fix
  - **FINDING-012**: Previous implementation still had build-time dependencies
  - **DECISION-012**: Fixed existing files, cleaned up orphaned files, corrected GitHub build
  - **RESULT**: Truly minimal container (~50-100MB), zero pre-installed deps, GitHub verified
- **TASK-2025-07-26-007**: FFmpeg Package Configuration Fix → See JOURNAL.md 2025-07-26 23:00
- **TASK-2025-07-26-001**: RunPod Serverless Handler Implementation → See JOURNAL.md 2025-07-26 12:00
