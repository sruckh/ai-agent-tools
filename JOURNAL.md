### Documentation Framework Implementation
- **What**: Implemented Claude Conductor modular documentation system
- **Why**: Improve AI navigation and code maintainability
- **How**: Used `npx claude-conductor` to initialize framework
- **Issues**: None - clean implementation
- **Result**: Documentation framework successfully initialized

### RunPod Serverless Handler Implementation |TASK:TASK-2025-07-26-001|
- **What**: Implemented comprehensive RunPod serverless handlers for AI Agents No-Code Tools
- **Why**: Convert Docker container to scalable, GPU-accelerated serverless architecture for better performance and cost efficiency
- **How**: Created modular handler system with base classes, TTS handler, video processing handler, and S3 storage integration
- **Issues**: Initially struggled with RunPod handler format requirements, resolved by creating standardized base handler class
- **Result**: Complete serverless implementation with 6/8 core components ready for deployment

#### Implementation Details
- **RunPodBaseHandler**: Base class with error handling, logging, response formatting (server.py:50+)
- **RunPodStorageHandler**: S3-compatible storage operations for file management
- **TTS Handler**: Kokoro TTS and ChatterboxTTS with GPU acceleration and voice management
- **Video Handler**: Video merging, frame extraction, color key overlay, captioning support
- **Utility Functions**: Temporary directory management, base64 extraction, cleanup routines

#### Technical Achievements
- GPU-optimized processing pipeline for AI models
- Automatic resource cleanup and memory management
- Comprehensive error handling with structured logging
- S3 storage integration with presigned URLs
- Modular architecture enabling independent handler scaling

#### Next Steps
- Extract handler code to separate files
- Create RunPod-specific Dockerfile
- Setup GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Implement remaining STT handler
