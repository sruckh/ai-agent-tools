# Docker Syntax Fixes for RunPod Dockerfile

## Issue Summary
The runpod.Dockerfile had critical syntax errors that prevented GitHub Actions CI/CD builds from succeeding. Two separate occurrences of multi-line Python commands in RUN instructions were being incorrectly parsed by Docker Buildx.

## Technical Problems

### Issue 1: Multi-line Bash Script (Lines 36-63)
- **Error**: `dockerfile parse error on line 37: unknown instruction: HANDLER_TYPE=${HANDLER_TYPE:-tts}`
- **Cause**: Multi-line RUN command creating entrypoint script not properly escaped
- **Solution**: Used proper `\n\` escaping for line continuations in bash script

### Issue 2: Multi-line Python Command (Lines 66-67)
- **Error**: `dockerfile parse error on line 67: unknown instruction: try:`
- **Cause**: Multi-line Python try/except block interpreted as separate Docker instructions
- **Solution**: Converted to single-line format using semicolons: `RUN python3 -c "try: ...; except: ..."`

## Root Cause Analysis
Docker Buildx parser requires specific syntax for multi-line commands:
- Bash scripts: Use `\n\` escaping within quoted strings
- Python commands: Use semicolons to separate statements in single-line format
- Any unescaped newline is interpreted as end of instruction

## Prevention Strategies
1. **Audit Pattern**: When fixing one multi-line syntax error, audit entire file for similar patterns
2. **Testing**: Always test Dockerfile syntax with `docker build` before committing
3. **Escaping**: Use proper escaping for embedded scripts in RUN commands
4. **Single-line Preference**: Prefer single-line Python commands with semicolons over multi-line

## Files Modified
- `runpod.Dockerfile:36-63` - Fixed bash script escaping
- `runpod.Dockerfile:66` - Converted Python command to single-line
- `TASKS.md` - Updated task completion status
- `JOURNAL.md` - Added comprehensive documentation entries

## Impact
- Unblocked GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Enabled automated builds for all three Docker variants
- Prevented future similar syntax errors through comprehensive audit
