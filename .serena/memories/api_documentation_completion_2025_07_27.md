# API Documentation Completion - July 27, 2025

## Overview
Completed comprehensive RunPod serverless API documentation update for AI Agents No-Code Tools project.

## What Was Done
- **Analyzed Handler Implementations**: Examined server.py and all handler files (audio_handler.py, video_handler.py, storage_handler.py) to understand actual endpoint operations
- **Created Complete API Documentation**: Replaced template content in API.md with detailed documentation for all 13 endpoints across 4 handler types
- **Provided Working Examples**: Created ready-to-use curl commands and RunPod console JSON for every endpoint operation

## Handler Types Documented
1. **TTS Handler** (3 operations):
   - generate_kokoro_tts: High-quality TTS with voice selection
   - generate_chatterbox_tts: TTS with voice cloning capabilities
   - get_kokoro_voices: List available voices with language filtering

2. **Audio Handler** (1 operation):
   - transcribe: Speech-to-text using Whisper STT model

3. **Video Handler** (3 operations):
   - generate_captioned_video: Create videos with captions from text/audio
   - merge_videos: Combine multiple videos with background music
   - add_colorkey_overlay: Apply green screen effects

4. **Storage Handler** (4 operations):
   - upload: Upload files from base64 data or URLs
   - download: Generate presigned download URLs
   - delete: Remove files from storage
   - status: Check file existence

## Documentation Features
- **Complete Parameter Tables**: Type, required status, descriptions with defaults and ranges
- **Working Examples**: Curl commands and RunPod console JSON ready for testing
- **Response Documentation**: Realistic response structures with example data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and format documentation
- **Integration Guidance**: Authentication, rate limiting, async operations, webhooks

## Technical Context
- Uses RunPod serverless API format with input object containing handler, operation, and parameters
- Supports both synchronous (/runsync) and asynchronous (/run) operations
- Integrates with S3-compatible storage for file operations
- Requires specific environment variables for deployment

## Production Impact
- Enables rapid developer onboarding with clear endpoint documentation
- Provides immediate testing capability through console JSON examples
- Reduces support burden through comprehensive error handling documentation
- Includes complete deployment configuration guidance

## Files Modified
- **API.md**: Complete rewrite from template to production documentation
- **TASKS.md**: Updated with task completion details
- **JOURNAL.md**: Added comprehensive task completion entry

## Context for Future Work
This documentation supports the ultra-slim RunPod serverless container implementation completed in previous tasks. The API documentation is now ready for production deployment and developer integration.
